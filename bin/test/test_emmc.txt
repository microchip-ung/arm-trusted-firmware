The test_emmc.bin file is used for running the built-in-system-test harness on
the EVB board.
The *.bin file needs to be flashed to the first LBA address of 0x0 inside the
eMMC device. Afterwards the test suite will adjust different speed modes and
bus width settings and compare the transfered data with the expected test pattern.

Tested eMMC configuration modes:

10 MHz - 1 bit bus width
10 MHz - 4 bit bus width
10 MHz - 8 bit bus width

26 MHz - 1 bit bus width
26 MHz - 4 bit bus width
26 MHz - 8 bit bus width

52 MHz - 1 bit bus width
52 MHz - 4 bit bus width
52 MHz - 8 bit bus width
